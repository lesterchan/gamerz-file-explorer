```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
}
rewrite ^/sortby/(.+[^/])/sortorder/(.+[^/])/?$ /index.php?by=$1&order=$2 last;
rewrite ^/browse/(.+[^/])/sortby/(.+[^/])/sortorder/(.+[^/])/?$ /index.php?dir=$1&by=$2&order=$3 last;
rewrite ^/browse/(.+[^/])/?$ /index.php?dir=$1 last;
rewrite ^/viewing/(.+[^/])/?$ /view.php?file=$1 last;
rewrite ^/download/(.+[^/])/?$ /view.php?file=$1&dl=1 last;
```

#### Upload These Files To The Directory You Specify In `GFE_DIR`
